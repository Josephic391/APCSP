		<p>Junior year has been the most difficult year out of any so far. I've taken significantly harder classes with a larger workload meaning a lot of my time is taken up by school. However, it means that it is even more satisfying to succeed.</p>

		<h3>Favorite Book</h3>
		<img src = "book.jpg">
		<p>My favorite book is "The King In Yellow" by Robert W. Chambers. It is a collection of 10 short stories and several poems. The original 4 stories belong to the genres of supernatural horror and weird fiction, all mentioning the titular play, forbidden play which induces despair or madness in those who read it.  </p>
